### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript

const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("I don't know what to do!");
  if (hungry === true) {
    if (availableTime < 20) {
      return "pick up a snack or grab something you have ready at home.";
    } else if (availableTime >= 20 && availableTime <= 30) {
      return "you deserve a break and should take time to cook a tasty meal.";
    } else if (availableTime > 30) {
      return "this is an intense program after all and you should probably reconsider.";
    }
  } else {
    return "Wait untill you are hungry";
  }
};

```
